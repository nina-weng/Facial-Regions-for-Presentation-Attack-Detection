**Task description**: see [task-description](./RPA-task-description.pdf)



## Dataset

related paper: https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy.findit.dtu.dk/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6199754

There are 50 subjects in this dataset. For each subject, there are 12 videos with low, mid, high quality. And it contains 3 kinds of attack: warped photo attack, cut photo attack, and video attack.





## Mission Completion Step-by-step

1. scripts for {video2frames, face detection, facial alignment}

   1. extract frames using cv2

      â€‹	store in *train_frames* folder

   2. extract normalized face image using landmarks

      * detect 81 landmarks (ref: https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat)
      * align the face image first according to interpupil distance and angle (affine operation)
      * crop the image to normalized one according to ISO/IEC 19794-5

      store in *train_normalized* folder

      **crop error on video type 2,5,6**

2. scripts for extract different facial regions 

   normalized face with shape (width: 300, height: 400)

3. scripts for PAD approach (better not too computational consuming) 

   1. some reference ideas:
      * [use only a single frame, based on color space histogram](https://github.com/ee09115/spoofing_detection) might not be so suitable for our case
      * the easiest way: extract features (not sure what features) from frames and than use classifier.
      * we could start with for example 10 video (or even 5) for training and 5 for testing, to reduce the computational cost for now. (notice the video quality and PA type)
      * Handbook might has some clues for where to start

4. experiment design 

   1. ideas: known attack + challenges on unknow attack types

   2. ablation study on facial regions

   3. fusion study (refer on the first reference)

      

5. analyze on the result (DET, EER etc.)

   

## Might-interesting Ideas

- fusion on facial regions 
- unknown attack + facial region 
- cross database, might be hard and time-consuming
