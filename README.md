# Facial-Regions-for-Presentation-Attack-Detection
02238 course project

**Task description**: see [task-description](./RPA-task-description.pdf)



## Mission Completion Step-by-step

1. scripts for {video2frames, face detection, facial alignment} (6.15 TUE)

2. scripts for extract different facial regions (6.15 TUE)

3. scripts for PAD approach (better not too computational consuming) (6.16 WED and 6.17 THU)

4. experiment design 

   1. ideas: known attack + challenges on unknow attack types

   2. ablation study on facial regions

   3. fusion study (refer on the first reference)

      

5. analyze on the result (DET, EER etc.)

   

## Might-interesting Ideas

- fusion on facial regions 
- unknown attack + facial region 
- cross database, might be hard and time-consuming
